Based on an actual experiment devised by director/actor Daryl Wein and actress Zoe Lister-Jones, the film loosely interprets a year in their lives exploring alternatives to monogamy, and the madness that ensues. An uncensored look at young love, lust, and the pangs of codependency, 'Breaking Upwards' follows its characters as they navigate each others' emotions across the city they love. It begs the question: is it ever possible to grow apart together?",1,96,2009,3,14,Zoe Lister-Jones,Daryl Wein,Julie White,Andrea Martin,Peter Friedman,,Kyle Forester,Daryl Wein,,Zoe Lister-Jones,life new york couple,lives exploring alternatives,grow apart together
